This is a collection of some different projects I've made using Java in Processing. Some of these were made for fun, while others were made as school projects in highschool

<h3>Explanations of projects where the name doesn't make the project obvious:</h3>
- The "Traveling Salesman" program uses Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) as a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem.
- "Smart Rockets" is an evolutionary simulation of rockets where in each generation, the rockets closest to the target (highest fitness) passes some genes to the next generation.

<h3>IF YOU TRY TO RUN THESE:</h3> Make sure that you have processing installed (https://processing.org/download), and that within a project folder, you run the script which has the same name as the folder itself.
